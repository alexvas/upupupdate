This tool is intended to run on the Google App Engine. Application users are assigned into teams by administrator. Every user of the team gets an email on regular basis, which he or she have to answer until some deadline (end of the day, usually). Answer email is counted as a report. After deadline all team reports for the latest period are combined and sent back to team members as a digest.
